ETL - Extract, Transform, Load
Having a stable and efficient ETL pipeline is no easy task, but with the right tools and technology it can be made that much easier. We can help you define the pipeline and build it too, creating an end to end workflow for all your data needs. Whether you are extracting data from an existing database, pulling data from an API, or simply lading it from a file, an extraction workflow will be tailor made to suit your needs. Transforming the data can provide a powerful way to customise the format to suit your business needs and this is also covered in the end to end ETL process. We can also help you load this data into your existing data warehouse or database wherever it might be.
